 This is an app for the connect-four board game, a rather well know game in which two players take turns 'dropping' colored discs into an upright board of 7 columns and 6 rows. Both players are assigned discs of a different color. The discs fall down to the bottom of a column/top of the stack of discs already in a column. A winner is declared when four discs of the same color align either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

The game has two modes: play-against-the-AI and pass-and-play. A good idea to expand the game, would be to turn it into a networked game and have two people that have the app, play against each other.

It is important for me to put it out there: This is purely a learning exercise! I do not intend to commercialize this or distribute this in any way. I only intend to learn how to make an android app in a systematic way (given that the first app I made was chaotic madness).

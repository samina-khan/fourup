Android app for the connect-four board game

This is a rather well know game in which two players take turns 'dropping' colored discs into an upright board of 7 columns and 6 rows. Both players are assigned discs of a different color. The discs fall down to the bottom of a column/top of the stack of discs already in a column. A winner is declared when four discs of the same color align either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

The game will have three modes: play-against-the-AI, pass-and-play and play-online.

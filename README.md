 This is an app for the connect-four board game, a rather well know game in which two players take turns 'dropping' colored discs into an upright board of 7 columns and 6 rows. Both players are assigned discs of a different color. The discs fall down to the bottom of a column/top of the stack of discs already in a column. A winner is declared when four discs of the same color align either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

The game has two modes: 
- Play against AI : The game is played against the AI. Three rounds are played and a winner is declared.
- Pass and play:  Two people take turns playing on the same device. Three rounds are played and a winner is declared.

A good idea to expand the game:
- Play online: The game could be more fun if people could connect and play on the network against each other.

- Note: This is purely a learning exercise! I do not intend to commercialize this or distribute this in any way. I only intended to learn how to make an android app in a systematic way (given that the first app I made was chaotic madness).
